## Description
- First actual programming project (Made in the first half of my 1. semester) 
  -> Bad code structure, no design patterns, no / bad documentation
- Main in src/sample/GameApplication.java
- Watch out: Music is playing when the program starts (tune down your sound setting or click on the "Options" button to do it)
